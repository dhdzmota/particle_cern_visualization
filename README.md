# Project: Visualizing Real World Data
#### (By Daniel Hern√°ndez Mota)

For this project, the data base used was taken from the [TrackML particle Tracking Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/trackml-particle-identification) in Kaggle. 

Only one event was taken in consideration due to the fact that it was a huge amount of data, and in order to avoid difficult procedures (and for the purposes of this project), only the necessary quantity of data was used. 

In this project, we se a Kernel with the explanation and data exploration of all files. Some ideas were taken from [trackml-problem-explanation-and-data-exploration](https://www.kaggle.com/wesamelshamy/trackml-problem-explanation-and-data-exploration) kernel, however it was mostly done with interpretation and pure data anaylsis.

Hope you enjoy the data visualization.


(Some of the data plots are not shown in the github webpage, however, I include them here in order to have the visual representation)
